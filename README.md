# Agentic Graph RAG

A retrieval system that answers questions over your documents by combining two
views of the data — a **vector index** for meaning and a **knowledge graph** for
relationships — and letting a **tool-using agent** decide how to search.

It runs fully **local** (Ollama + open models, no API keys) or on **cloud APIs**
(Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, Voyage). Run just the API with `uvicorn`, or the whole
stack — graph database, cache, API, and web UI — with a single `docker compose up`.

---

## Why this exists

Ordinary RAG embeds your documents and returns the chunks closest to your
question. That is great for *"find the passage about X"* and useless for
*"how are X and Y connected?"* — because closeness in meaning is not the same as
a relationship in the world.

So this project stores your data **twice**:

| Representation | Answers questions like | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vector index | "find text about warehouse robots" | embed chunks, nearest-neighbor search |
| Knowledge graph | "who founded the company that makes the Pallet Pilot?" | entities + typed relationships |

An agent reads your question and chooses the right tool — vector search, graph
traversal, keyword lookup, or a combination. That is the "agentic" part: it is
not a fixed pipeline, it *reasons about how to retrieve*.

---

## How it works (the 60-second version)

**Ingesting a document:**

```
file ──▶ load ──▶ chunk ──▶ embed ──▶ vector index
   (PDF/Word/    │                        │
    HTML/CSV/    └──▶ LLM extracts ──▶ knowledge graph ──▶ resolve duplicates
    text/image)       entities +       (entities linked to      + summarize
                      relationships     the chunks that           communities
                                        mention them)
```

Images and scanned PDFs are read by a small vision model (**OCR**) before
chunking, so a picture of text becomes searchable text. A page goes to OCR when
its text layer is thinner than `ocr.min_text_chars` — not merely when it's empty,
because scans usually carry a page number or a scanner header, and "has some
text" is not "was read".

After a document lands, two enrichment passes run: **entity resolution** folds
duplicates the per-chunk extractor couldn't see were the same thing ("Acme" and
"Acme Robotics"), and **community summaries** cluster the graph and describe each
cluster, so the agent can answer whole-corpus questions, not just chunk lookups.

**Answering a question:**

```
question ──▶ agent ──▶ picks tool(s) ──▶ hybrid retrieval ──▶ rerank ──▶ answer + sources
                        │                 (vector ⊕ graph ⊕ keyword,
                        │                  run in parallel, fused with RRF)
                        └── graph_neighbors, expand_subgraph, compare,
                            get_entity, global_search, ...
```

The agent cites the exact chunks it used. Answers come in a **style** you choose
(concise / detailed / technical / ELI5), it can **compare** several subjects side
by side, and for corpus-wide questions ("what are the main themes?") it reads the
**community summaries** instead of hunting for a single passage. The three legs of
hybrid retrieval run concurrently, and the UI shows which tool the agent is
running while you wait.

For the full picture, see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## New: two features, built in — safety & observability

This is the head of a three-project series, and the other two are now **wired
into the RAG as optional features** while remaining their own standalone repos.
Both are **off by default** and **fail-safe** — a stock run is unchanged, and
neither can take the app down.

| Feature | What it does here | Turn it on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🛡️ **Guardrails & Safety Layer** | Screens every question **before** the agent runs (prompt-injection / jailbreak / off-topic / pasted secrets → refuse without spending a token) and every answer **after** (PII & secret **redaction**, RAG **groundedness**, system-prompt **leak**). | `safety.enabled: true` |
| 🔭 **llmlens observability** | Traces every agent run — prompts, latency, tokens, **cost per user**, tool calls, errors — to a self-hosted dashboard with alerting. One `instrument("langchain")` call captures the whole tool-using loop. | `observability.enabled: true` |

The features live under [`integrations/`](integrations/) (vendored copies of
their repos); the glue that connects them is in `src/graphrag/safety/` and
`src/graphrag/observability/`. Both run in the **same compose project** as the
RAG stack — one command brings up everything:

```bash
make deploy          # RAG + Guardrails + llmlens, one stack, one command
# or lighter:
make up-features     # RAG + Guardrails only (skips the heavier llmlens platform)
```

**How they're connected, end to end → [`docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`](docs/INTEGRATIONS.md).**

---

## Quickstart

### Option A — one command (Docker)

Brings up Neo4j, **Postgres**, Redis, the API, the web UI, and a **TLS reverse
proxy** together. Per-container RAM/CPU caps are set in `.env` (`*_MEM_LIMIT` /
`*_CPU_LIMIT`); the defaults target a 2 vCPU / 8 GB VPS.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> agentic-graph-rag && cd agentic-graph-rag
cp .env.example .env          # set the Neo4j + Postgres passwords and your API keys
make setup PROFILE=production # or: PROFILE=local  (fully local, no keys, no accounts)
make up
docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head   # create the account tables
```

The frontend only starts once the API reports healthy (compose waits on a
healthcheck), so when it's up, the whole stack is up. Then open:

- **Web UI** — http://localhost:5173
- **API docs (Swagger, test any endpoint here)** — http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Neo4j browser** — http://localhost:7474

Sign up with your email, enter the 6-digit code, and you're in. Without a
`RESEND_API_KEY` / `BREVO_API_KEY` the code is written to the server log instead
of sent — fine for a first run:

```bash
docker compose logs api | grep "code is"
```

To claim the admin panel, set `GRAPHRAG_ADMIN_EMAIL` to the address you signed
up with and restart, or promote it directly:

```bash
docker compose exec api graphrag promote-admin you@example.com
```

**The whole workflow lives in the browser:** drag-and-drop document upload with
per-file ingest progress, streaming chat that shows the **sources** behind every
answer, an account page with your usage against your limits, and — for admins —
users, limits, usage charts and per-tenant graph inspection.

> **Profiles decide whether authentication is on.** `local` and `api` are
> development profiles: auth is **off**, and any caller can act as any user via
> the `X-User-Id` header. Use `production` for anything reachable from a
> network. The API logs a warning at startup when auth is disabled.

**Switch the LLM between local and API with one line.** Set `GRAPHRAG_LLM` in
`.env` and restart the API — only the chat model changes, so your ingested
corpus keeps working (switching *profiles* also swaps the embedder, which
means re-ingesting):

```bash
GRAPHRAG_LLM=ollama:gemma4:e4b-it-q4_K_M   # ← local
GRAPHRAG_LLM=gemini:gemini-3.5-flash       # ← API
docker compose up -d api                   # apply
```

See [`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](docs/CONFIGURATION.md#the-one-change-llm-toggle).

Ingest the sample corpus and ask a question:

```bash
docker compose exec api graphrag ingest data/sample.md
# then ask in the web UI: "How are Acme Robotics and Riverside University connected?"
```

Fully local? The `local` profile talks to **the Ollama already running on your
host** (`host.docker.internal:11434`), so it reuses models you've pulled instead
of downloading them again inside a container. Pull these:

```bash
ollama pull gemma4:e4b-it-q4_K_M   # chat + reranking + graph extraction
ollama pull gemma3:4b              # OCR (reads images; see note below)
ollama pull bge-m3                 # embeddings
make setup PROFILE=local && make up
```

No Ollama on the host? Bring up the bundled one instead — `docker compose
--profile local up -d ollama`, set `GRAPHRAG_OLLAMA_BASE_URL_INTERNAL=http://ollama:11434`,
and pull the models inside that container.

**Why two models:** OCR and reasoning have different requirements, and a model
that claims both doesn't always deliver both. `gemma4:e4b-it-q4_K_M` reports
`vision` in `ollama show` but ignores attached images, so OCR uses `gemma3:4b`.
Extraction stays on gemma4 — gemma3 is small enough that it fills the graph with
document-local labels. Every role is a separate config key, so pick per role and
verify rather than trust the capability list. See
[`docs/PROVIDERS.md`](docs/PROVIDERS.md).

### Option B — just the API (no Docker)

You need a Neo4j and a Redis reachable from your machine, plus Postgres if you
want accounts (`docker compose up neo4j redis postgres`).

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,extras]"   # extras = Cohere/Voyage providers the cloud profiles use
cp .env.example .env          # point GRAPHRAG_NEO4J_* / _REDIS_URL / _DATABASE_URL at your services
alembic upgrade head          # only needed for the production profile
make serve PROFILE=local      # uvicorn on :8000, docs at /docs
graphrag ingest data/sample.md
graphrag query "How are Acme Robotics and Riverside University connected?"
```

---

## The API

With the `production` profile every request carries a **session cookie** (the
web UI) or an **API key** (`Authorization: Bearer grk_…`, for scripts). Each
account gets a fully isolated knowledge base — its own Neo4j corpus and its own
DuckDB vector file — while the heavy models are loaded once and shared across
everyone, so adding users costs almost no extra memory.

Development profiles have auth off and fall back to the `X-User-Id` header. See
[`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) → Multi-user.

```bash
# Sign up, verify, and use the session — or mint a key and skip the cookie:
graphrag apikey you@example.com
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer grk_…" -X POST localhost:8000/query \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"question":"...","stream":false}'
```

| Method | Path | What it does |

Every endpoint is testable interactively at **`/docs`** — that page is generated
by FastAPI, so "write and test a request" needs no extra tool.

---

## Configuration in one breath

Settings are layered: `configs/default.yaml` → `configs/<profile>.yaml` → `.env`.
Three ready-made profiles ship with the repo:

- **`production.yaml`** — the deployment: accounts and limits **on**, Gemini for
  chat (DeepSeek and Qwen selectable), Cohere `embed-v4.0` + `rerank-v4.0-fast`,
  DuckDB vectors, Postgres for accounts and agent memory. No torch anywhere.
- **`local.yaml`** — everything on your host's Ollama, no keys and no model
  weights downloaded: gemma4 for chat/rerank/extraction, gemma3 for OCR, `bge-m3`
  for embeddings. Auth off. (`local-gemma.yaml` swaps in a larger Gemma 4.)
- **`api.yaml`** — Claude (`claude-opus-4-8`), Voyage embeddings, Gemini OCR.
  Auth off.

Every model role is its own key — `llm`, `ingestion.llm`, `ocr.vision_llm`,
`retrieval.rerank`, `embeddings` — so you can run a different model per role, or
the same one everywhere. See [`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) and
[`docs/PROVIDERS.md`](docs/PROVIDERS.md). The embedding block exposes fine-grained
control (device, batch size, normalization, prefixes, Matryoshka dimensions,
caching).

**On a small GPU, `num_ctx` matters more than the model you pick** — twice over.

*It decides whether the model fits.* Ollama sizes its KV cache from the context
length, and that cache — not the weights — is usually what spills a model onto
the CPU: gemma4 at Ollama's default context is 9.9 GB and lands 71% on CPU, but
3.3 GB and 100% on GPU at `num_ctx: 8192`. `ollama ps` shows the split.

*And it decides how many models you load.* **Ollama keys a loaded runner by
(model, options), so the same model at two context sizes is two runners.** Give
chat 8192 and reranking 2048 and you haven't saved memory — you've told a 6 GB
card to hold two copies, so it evicts one to rerank and the other to answer,
twice per query. Measured: **33.4s split across two runners, 5.5s sharing one.**
That's why the local profile gives chat, reranking and extraction the *identical*
`num_ctx`, even where a smaller one would do — 4096 and 8192 are both 3.3 GB
anyway (16384 is the cliff), so the smaller number buys nothing and costs a swap.

The rule: **pick one context per model and use it everywhere that model appears.**
Different *models* (gemma3 for OCR, gemma4 for the rest) will still swap — that's
unavoidable on a small card — but the same model should never swap with itself.

---

## Which model runs what

Five roles, five independent config keys. The `local` profile fills them like
this — the choices aren't arbitrary, and the reasons generalise:

| Role | Config key | Default (`local`) | Why this one |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Chat / agent** | `llm.model` | `gemma4:e4b-it-q4_K_M` | Needs reliable tool calling; runs on every question |
| **Graph extraction** | `ingestion.llm.model` | `gemma4:e4b-it-q4_K_M` | Must resist naming notation; small models can't |
| **Reranking** | `retrieval.rerank.model` | `gemma4:e4b-it-q4_K_M` | Any model that returns a bare number |
| **OCR** | `ocr.vision_llm.model` | `gemma3:4b` | Needs vision that *works* — gemma4's doesn't |
| **Embeddings** | `embeddings.model` | `bge-m3:latest` | 1024-dim, multilingual, strong retrieval |

### Swapping a model

Change the key and restart — no code, no rebuild:

```yaml
llm:
  model: qwen2.5:7b-instruct     # ollama pull it first
  extra: { num_ctx: 8192 }       # then check `ollama ps` — see below
```

**Chat** — any Ollama model listing `tools` in `ollama show` (the agent binds
tools; without them it can't retrieve at all), or an API provider (`anthropic`,
`openai`, `gemini`). Note `gemma3:4b` has **no** `tools` — fine for OCR, useless
as the agent.

**Extraction** — needs to follow instructions well enough to skip notation, which
is a real bar: on notes full of transition tables, gemma3:4b filled the graph with
state names (`Q0`..`Q16`) while gemma4 on the same prompt emitted none. If graph
expansion looks like noise, this is the knob.

**Reranking** — the least fussy: it only has to answer with a number. Any chat
model, `cross_encoder` (faster and better, needs the `local-models` extra),
`cohere` / `voyage`, or `none`.

### A bigger model that doesn't fit is a slower model

Reach for a larger model and you'll usually get a worse system, not a better one.
The moment weights + KV cache exceed VRAM, Ollama runs the overflow on CPU and
the quality gain is spent paying for it. Measured on a 6 GB card (RTX 2060),
same prompt, both warm:

| Chat model | VRAM @ ctx 8192 | On GPU | Speed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gemma4:e4b-it-q4_K_M` (8B) | 3.3 GB | **100%** | **41.2 tok/s** |
| `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` (7B) | 5.4 GB | 79% | 27.7 tok/s |

qwen2.5 is the stronger model and its tool calling works — but at 5.4 GB it never
fits alongside the ~1 GB the desktop already holds, so a fifth of it runs on CPU
and it ends up **~50% slower**. No context helps: it's 82% on GPU even at 4096.

So size the model to the card, not the benchmark. `ollama ps` is the whole test —
anything under `100% GPU` means you're paying for weights you can't use. On a
larger card the same comparison flips, which is exactly why this is a config key
and not a hardcoded default.

**OCR** — must be a *vision* model, and the capability list lies. `gemma3:4b`
works; `gemma4:e4b-it-q4_K_M` advertises `vision` and silently ignores images.
`gemini` + `gemini-2.5-flash` is the cloud option, and `ocr.engine: tesseract`
skips models entirely (good for clean printed text, poor for handwriting).

**Embeddings** — `bge-m3:latest` (1024), `nomic-embed-text` (768),
`mxbai-embed-large` (1024), or an API provider. Two catches: point
`embeddings.tokenizer` at the matching HF repo when the model name is an Ollama
tag (Ollama tags aren't HF repo ids, and chunk sizing silently degrades without
it), and **changing dimensions means re-ingesting** — the Neo4j vector index is
created with a fixed width, so a 768-dim model against a 1024-dim index will not
work. Drop the index and re-ingest when you switch.

### Test the model, don't trust the tag

`ollama show <model>` lists capabilities, and it's worth reading — it reliably
tells you what's ruled *out* (no `tools` means it can't be the agent; no
`embedding` means it can't embed). It does not tell you what works:

- `gemma4:e4b-it-q4_K_M` lists `vision`, then answers "please provide the image".
- A GGUF named `Qwen3-VL-Reranker` reports **no** `vision` at all despite the
  "VL", and scores an irrelevant document 10/10 — it reranks nothing.

Both failures are silent: ingest still reports `status=done`, queries still
return an answer. **Swap a model, then check one page, one chunk, one query**
before trusting it.

The shape follows the two things the system does: **put documents in** and **get
answers out**. Read it in that order and it explains itself.

### How a request moves through it

**Ingesting** `report.pdf`:

```
api/routers/ingest.py   checks the caller's quota, stores the file, queues a job
        │                 (in-process by default — the DuckDB vector store needs
        │                  one owner per file; GRAPHRAG_USE_WORKER hands it to
        │                  worker.py instead)
pipelines/ingest.py     drives the rest:
  loaders/pdf.py          PDF ──▶ text   (ocr/ if a page is a scan)
  chunking/               text ──▶ chunks
  embeddings/             chunks ──▶ vectors ──▶ storage/vector  (the user's DuckDB file)
  extraction/             chunks ──▶ entities + relations ──▶ storage/graph
```

**Answering** *"How are Acme and Riverside connected?"*:

```
api/deps.py             resolves the caller: session cookie ──▶ API key ──▶ (dev header)

### Why it's shaped this way

**`core/` depends on nothing.** Types and errors sit at the bottom, so no two
modules ever need to import each other to agree on what a `Chunk` is.

**Every provider hides behind an interface.** `Embedder`, `GraphStore`,
`VectorStore`, `Reranker`, `OCREngine` — each is a small abstract class with a
concrete implementation per backend. Swapping Ollama for OpenAI is one new class
and one config line; nothing around it changes. That's why every model in this
README is a config key and not an `if` statement somewhere.

**`container.py` is the only place that knows how the pieces fit.** It reads the
config and builds the object graph once. Heavy things (models, drivers) are
`@cached_property`, so they load on first use and are shared by every user. That's
why adding users costs almost no memory — only the small per-tenant wrappers are
duplicated.

**Ingest runs off the request, not off the process.** The slow work (OCR,
embedding, extraction) runs as a background task under a semaphore, so a large
upload never blocks a chat stream and two uploads can't fight over the same two
cores. It stays *in* the API process because each user's DuckDB vector file
needs a single owner; set `GRAPHRAG_USE_WORKER=1` (with the Neo4j vector
provider) to hand it to a separately capped worker container instead.

**Reading it for the first time?** `core/types.py` (the vocabulary) ──▶
`configs/default.yaml` (every knob, commented) ──▶ `container.py` (how it's
wired) ──▶ `pipelines/` (the two flows end to end). `tests/unit/` runs in under a
second with no Neo4j or Ollama, and each test documents one real failure mode.

## Production hardening

This is built to run as a controllable service, not just a demo. What's in place:

- **Real accounts.** Email + password, with a 6-digit code proving the address
  exists before the account activates. Sessions are server-side: the cookie
  carries an opaque token, the database stores only its hash, and it's httpOnly
  + SameSite=Lax with the Secure flag following the request scheme. Suspending
  an account kills its sessions *and* its API keys on the next request — the
  reason sessions aren't stateless tokens. Signup, resend and login answer
  identically for known and unknown addresses so they can't be used to discover
  who has an account.
- **Enforced per-user limits.** Messages per minute and per day, token budgets
  per day and month, document count, per-file and total storage, indexed chunks,
  conversations. A refused request never reaches the model, and the 429 names
  the limit, the ceiling and the reset so the UI can say "12 of 12 today, resets
  in 4 hours". Rate windows live in Redis (fast, and fail *open* so a cache blip
  doesn't lock everyone out); the caps guarding durable resources read Postgres,
  so a deleted file returns its quota automatically.
- **Admin dashboard.** Users with search and status filters, per-user detail
  with usage and knowledge-graph stats, limits edited globally / per user / in
  bulk, usage charts, model availability, system status, and a full purge that
  clears a user from Postgres, Neo4j, DuckDB and disk. Every mutation is
  audited. Gated by an admin role, with `X-Admin-Key` as break-glass for
  bootstrap; **fails closed** when neither is configured.
- **Durable agent memory.** Conversation memory uses a LangGraph checkpointer in
  Postgres (Redis also supported, with redis-stack), so multi-turn context
  survives restarts. The API uses the async saver (its streaming needs it), the
  CLI the sync one — same keyspace, so both see the same threads. If the
  configured backend is unusable the API tries the other one before settling for
  in-process memory, rather than silently losing conversations.
- **Per-user isolation.** Each account gets its own Neo4j corpus *and* its own
  DuckDB vector file, so one user's data is a separate artifact that can be
  backed up, inspected or deleted on its own. Thread and file ids are checked
  against the owner on every access, and a resource you don't own returns 404,
  not 403 — ids can't be probed.
- **Resource controls.** Every container has RAM/CPU caps (`.env`:
  `API_MEM_LIMIT`, `NEO4J_MEM_LIMIT`, `NEO4J_HEAP`, `POSTGRES_MEM_LIMIT`, …),
  defaulting to a set that fits 2 vCPU / 8 GB with headroom, plus CPU-thread caps
  (`OMP_NUM_THREADS`) so local models can't starve the host.
- **Confined server-side ingest.** `POST /ingest` with a path is fenced to
  `data/` (an attempt to reach `.env` or any other server file is a 400), and it
  also accepts an http(s) URL, fetched with a size cap. Uploads go through
  `/ingest/upload` regardless. Raising `max_upload_mb` also needs `MAX_UPLOAD_MB`
  in `.env` raised — nginx rejects oversized bodies before the API sees them.
- **Prompt-injection hardening.** Retrieved documents are attacker-controlled, so
  everything a tool returns is sanitized (control characters, chat-template
  special tokens) and wrapped in `<untrusted_data>` markers the system prompt
  defines as evidence, never instructions. A chunk can't forge the closing
  marker to escape its envelope. Tool output is capped, and nothing
  user-supplied reaches a prompt except the question: the answer style is
  enum-clamped, the model is validated against an allowlist, and the thread id
  is ownership-checked.
- **Observability.** Prometheus metrics at `/metrics` (request counts + latency
  histograms, labeled by route template so cardinality stays bounded), durable
  usage events in Postgres behind the admin charts, and structured request logs.
  A `make eval` target scores retrieval and answers against a golden set
  (`data/eval/qa.yaml`) so retrieval changes are measured, not guessed.
- **TLS + reverse proxy.** A **Caddy** proxy is the public entrypoint (80/443):
  it terminates TLS, routes `/api/*` → API and everything else → the UI (and
  streams SSE). Behind it the UI and API share one origin, so CORS isn't needed.

### Exposing it over HTTPS

The proxy handles certificates automatically — you just set `SITE_ADDRESS`:

| `SITE_ADDRESS` | Result |
|---|---|
| `:80` (default) | Plain HTTP on port 80 — local dev |
| `localhost` | HTTPS via Caddy's local self-signed CA |
| `rag.example.com` | **HTTPS via automatic Let's Encrypt** (also set `TLS_EMAIL`) |

For a public domain: point its DNS A record at the host, set `SITE_ADDRESS` and
`TLS_EMAIL` in `.env`, and `docker compose up` — Caddy provisions and renews the
cert on :443 and redirects HTTP→HTTPS. For a real deployment, also remove the
host `ports` from the `api`/`frontend` services so only the proxy is reachable.

Still on the roadmap: backups and restore drills for Postgres + the per-user
DuckDB files, distributed tracing, and the quantized ANN backends sketched in
[`docs/OPTIMIZATION-NOTES.md`](docs/OPTIMIZATION-NOTES.md) — the exact cosine
scan DuckDB uses is honest and fast at the per-user chunk ceiling, but it is a
scan.

## Development

```bash
make install     # editable install with dev + extra providers
make test        # unit tests (fast, no services)
make eval        # score retrieval + answers vs the golden set (needs the stack up)
make lint        # ruff + mypy
make fmt         # auto-format
```

Integration tests need a real Postgres. They create and drop the schema
themselves, so they refuse any database whose name doesn't look disposable:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
docker compose exec postgres psql -U graphrag -d graphrag -c "CREATE DATABASE graphrag_test OWNER graphrag;"
GRAPHRAG_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://graphrag:change-me@localhost:5432/graphrag_test \
  pytest -m integration -q
```

The frontend is a separate build:

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # Vite on :5173, proxying /api to :8000
npm run build                               # tsc + production bundle
```
