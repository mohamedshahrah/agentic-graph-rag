"""Fixtures for tests that need real services.

Run them with a live Postgres (and Redis, optionally):

    docker compose up -d postgres redis neo4j
    GRAPHRAG_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://graphrag:change-me@localhost:5432/graphrag \
      pytest -m integration

Each test gets a schema-fresh database: tables are created from the models and
dropped afterwards, so a failed run cannot poison the next one.
