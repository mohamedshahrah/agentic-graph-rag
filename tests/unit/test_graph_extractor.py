"""Entity extraction: keeping notation out of the knowledge graph.

Technical notes are full of symbols and grammar rules. Small local models happily
return "$", "AB" and "11" as entities, which clutters graph expansion. The prompt
asks for restraint; this is the floor that doesn't depend on the model obeying.
