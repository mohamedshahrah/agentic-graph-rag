# Architecture

This document explains how the system is put together and, more importantly,
*why* it is put together that way. Read it top to bottom once; after that the code
should be self-explanatory.

## The core idea

Plain RAG embeds your documents and, at query time, returns the chunks whose
vectors are closest to the question. That works well until the answer depends on
a *relationship* rather than a *similarity* — "how are A and B connected?",
"what did the person who founded X do before?". Those questions need a graph.

This project keeps both representations of your data:

- a **vector index** for "find text that means roughly this", and
- a **knowledge graph** of entities and typed relationships for "follow the
  connections".

An **agent** sits on top and decides, per question, which to use — often both.

## The layers

Each arrow is an interface. Swapping an implementation (a different LLM, a
different store) means writing one adapter, not touching the layers around it.

        ▲
  Ingestion:  load → chunk → embed → extract entities/relations → store
```

## Ingestion, step by step

1. **Load.** A loader turns a file into plain text. Images and scanned PDFs go
   through **OCR** first (a small vision model — Gemma 4 locally, Gemini in the
   cloud — reads the text out of the picture).
2. **Chunk.** Text is split into retrievable pieces. The chunker uses the
   *embedding model's own tokenizer* to measure size, so a chunk never exceeds
   what the embedder can encode. (See `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` → chunking.)
3. **Embed.** Each chunk becomes a vector. Vectors are cached in Redis so
   re-ingesting the same text is free.
4. **Extract.** The LLM reads each chunk and pulls out entities and the typed
   relationships between them. These become nodes and edges in Neo4j, and each
   chunk is linked to the entities it mentions (`Chunk -[:MENTIONS]-> Entity`).
   Extraction calls run concurrently (`ingestion.max_concurrency`).
5. **Store.** Chunk vectors live on `:Chunk` nodes with a native Neo4j vector
   index (or in the file-backed `local` store); entities and relations form the
   graph. One database holds both, so going from a matched chunk to its entities
   is a single hop.
6. **Enrich.** Once the document is stored, two passes run: **entity resolution**
   merges duplicates the per-chunk extractor couldn't ("Acme" / "Acme Robotics"),
   and **community detection** clusters the graph and LLM-summarizes each cluster.
   Those summaries answer whole-corpus questions that no single chunk can, via the
   agent's `global_search` tool.

Every node carries a `corpus` tag and every constraint, index, read, and write is
keyed on it — that (not a shared bare key) is what keeps one tenant's entities and
answers out of another's.

## Answering a question

1. The agent receives the question plus a style instruction.
2. It picks tools. `hybrid_search` is the default; `graph_neighbors` /
   `expand_subgraph` follow relationships; `compare` gathers evidence about
   several subjects at once. Tool descriptions live in `agent/tools.py`.
3. Every tool records the exact chunks it surfaced, so the API can return
   precise sources alongside the answer.
4. **Hybrid retrieval** runs vector, graph-augmented, and keyword search
   concurrently (a thread apiece), fuses the three rankings with Reciprocal Rank
   Fusion (which needs no comparable scores), then a reranker orders the
   finalists. Graph-augmented retrieval doesn't just re-find the seed entities —
   it follows relationships out to `graph_hops` and scores chunks by graph
   distance.
5. The agent writes the answer in the requested style, citing sources.

Multi-turn memory is handled by a LangGraph checkpointer keyed on a `thread_id`
(Redis-backed when reachable, in-process otherwise). The API and CLI use the
async and sync saver flavors respectively over one keyspace — the async one is
required because `/query` streams over `astream`. The streaming path also emits
`tool` events as the agent picks strategies, so the UI can show activity instead
of sitting silent through retrieval.

## Why these choices

- **Neo4j as the default store** — mature Cypher, a native vector index, and
  full-text search in one engine, so graph + vectors don't need two systems.
  It's behind a `GraphStore`/`VectorStore` interface, so an embedded backend can
  be added without touching retrieval.
- **LangGraph + LangChain integrations** — one `bind_tools` interface across
  Ollama, Claude, OpenAI, and Gemini is what makes "swap local ↔ API" a
  one-line config change. The trade-off is a heavier dependency; the domain
  layer stays framework-free so we're not locked in.
- **A composition root (`container.py`)** — all wiring in one place, lazily
  built. Nothing constructs its own dependencies, which keeps everything
  testable and swappable.

## Multi-user & memory

Each user has an **isolated knowledge base**, but that isolation is deliberately
cheap. The design splits into two objects:

- **`Container`** — the composition root, holding the *heavy, shared* singletons:
  the embedding model, the reranker model, the LLM client, the Neo4j driver, and
  Redis. Built once for the whole process.
- **`Tenant`** — a *lightweight, per-user* view. It binds thin store / retriever /
  agent wrappers to that user's namespace while **reusing the container's shared
  models**.

That split is the memory optimization: N users cost N sets of small wrappers, not
N copies of the models (which are what actually consume RAM/VRAM). The tenant
cache is an LRU bounded by `tenancy.max_active_tenants` — evicting a tenant frees
only wrappers; the models stay resident.

**How isolation works.** By default, every node a user ingests is tagged with a
`corpus` equal to their user id, and every query filters on it — so one Neo4j
database (Community-friendly) cleanly separates users. Set
`tenancy.per_tenant_database: true` to instead give each user a real Neo4j
database (Enterprise). Conversation memory threads are namespaced `"{user}:{thread}"`,
so history never leaks across accounts.

**Request routing.** The API reads `X-User-Id`; `Container.tenant(user)` resolves
(and lazily prepares) that user's namespace, reusing the shared models. The CLI
takes `--user`; the UI has a user picker.

## Deployment — one command, end to end

`docker compose up` starts the services that form the whole workflow:

```
                              proxy (Caddy, TLS on 80/443)
                                │  /api/* → api,  else → frontend
neo4j ─┐                        ▼
redis ─┼─▶ api ──(healthy?)──▶ frontend   (React UI, nginx)
       │   (FastAPI)
       ├─▶ worker  (Arq — runs ingestion off the API, resource-capped)
       └── ollama  (optional, `local` profile — runs open models)
```

The **proxy** is the public entrypoint: it terminates TLS (automatic Let's
Encrypt for a real domain, self-signed for `localhost`), forwards `/api/*` to the
API with response buffering off so SSE streams, and serves everything else from
the frontend. Because the UI and API are same-origin behind it, CORS isn't
needed in that path.

Ingestion is **queued**: an upload enqueues a job on Redis, the `worker` picks it
up and runs the (blocking) embed + graph-extraction pipeline, and job status is
written back to Redis for the API to poll. That keeps the API responsive and puts
the heavy CPU/RAM work in a container you cap independently (`WORKER_MEM_LIMIT`,
`GRAPHRAG_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`). Every container has RAM/CPU limits set from `.env`.

The ordering is health-gated, so "the UI is up" means "the stack is up":

- `neo4j` and `redis` expose healthchecks; `api` waits for both to be healthy
  before starting.
- `api` exposes its own healthcheck (`/health`); `frontend` waits for `api` to be
  healthy. Its `start_period` is generous because the first request may download
  local models.

The **frontend is a served part of the stack**, not a dev-only tool: its own
nginx container serves the built React app and proxies `/api/*` to the backend
(the same proxy handles SSE streaming). Everything a user needs is in the
browser:

- a **status bar** that polls `/ready` and shows API / Neo4j / Redis health,
- a **drag-and-drop upload** that runs the ingest pipeline and streams per-file
  progress (chunks and entities extracted),
- a **streaming chat** that shows the exact sources behind each answer.

So the full loop — add documents → ask → get a grounded, cited answer, while
watching the system's health — is driven entirely from the served UI. Nothing
here is Docker-specific: the same API runs bare under `uvicorn`, and the UI runs
under `vite dev` (which proxies to `localhost:8000`).
